      <description>Hi friends, I’m Eric.
In my 20-ish year professional life, I’ve been an astrophysicist, defense researcher, data scientist, software developer, manager, and startup co-founder. At home, I’m a husband, dad, video gamer, and occasional guitar noodler. I get pleasure out of asking questions and learning new things, and I love to share what I’ve learned.
My mission here is to write about subjects I enjoy in a way that I think might be somewhat engaging and accessible.</description>
